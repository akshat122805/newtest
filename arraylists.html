         <h2 class="section-title">ArrayLists & Sorts</h2>
        <p>An ArrayList is part of the Java Collections Framework and provides a resizable array implementation. Unlike standard arrays, ArrayLists can dynamically grow and shrink in size as elements are added or removed. This flexibility makes ArrayLists particularly useful when dealing with collections of data where the number of elements may change over time. ArrayLists offer methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements, making them easier to work with than arrays in many scenarios. They are defined in the java.util package and are commonly used for tasks such as managing dynamic lists, handling user inputs, and storing collections of objects.</p>
